#Project Description

## Name
Peer Review - Work Evaluation Management System

## Description
The members of every organization are responsible for the quality of the products. One mechanism for self-regulation
and coverage of the organization's standards is the peer work review system. This could be in many forms,
but in general it is a peer review of the submitted work item - code, tests, documents etc.

The workflow is usually the following: user submits some work (code, documentation), assigns a reviewer, the reviewer
can comment, approve, request changes, or decline the work item. Once the reviewer approves or rejects the work item,
it is marked as complete.

The system allows submitting work items, assigning other user as reviewer, attach files and download them for later.
The reviewer and the team the creator is part of can add comments and therefore to improve the work item not only
through individual contribution but as a teamwork. The reviewer also can request additional changes, approve, 
or decline the work item.
